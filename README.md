# EURDL
(Extended URDL) Improved version of URDL cipher software implementaion with new UI using Qt. Fixed several problems with the original version

## _Algorithm improvements_

Original algorithm is described here: https://github.com/MaxSaganyuk/URDL-Cipher

New version of the algorithm includes different paterns instead of only Up Right Down Left pattern. 
EURDL encodes the pattern with the information in the key itself. 
Example key: "hn1r!j4i9da27gpzyolexcfk0bs3t$w586~qvum@"
